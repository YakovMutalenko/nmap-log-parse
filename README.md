Logs which devices are in your local network and draws graphs

## Setup

1. Add this line to your **_root_** crontab on your raspberry pi (or other device that is always on):

    `*/10 * * * * nmap -sn '192.168.178.*' -oX - >> /var/www/nmap-logs/$(date -I).xml`

    You can edit the root crontab by running something like `sudo EDITOR=nano crontab -e`

    Replace `'192.168.178.*'` with your network range and `/var/www/nmap-logs/` with the target location.

    This takes about ~10MB of storage per month.

    **The above command _must_ be put into the root crontab!**
    Otherwise, nmap can't read mac-addresses and the output will be wrong.

2. create a `config.json` file in the same folder as the `index.html` is in,
   overriding any of the values in the [default config](./config.ts).

    for example:

    **config.json**

    ```json
    {
    	"logFilesPath": "/nmap/logs/",
    	"staticLogFiles": ["logs/oldlogs"],
    	"deviceNames": {
    		"AB:CD:EF:01:23": "John's PC"
    	}
    }
    ```

    Use `staticLogFiles` only if you have an undated log file from an older version.

3. Wait more than an hour. Make sure the first log file (in the form 2016-06-29.xml) exists and contains XML documents.
4. Open `index.html` in a browser. Open it from a server (like a minimal `python3 -m http.server`) instead of from the filesystem because of Cross-Domain security.

## Contributing

Made with [React], the [Dexie.js] database and [Highcharts].

Get the dependencies using `npm install`, then run `webpack --watch` to build.

This project is written in [TypeScript], which is basically JavaScript (ES6), but strongly typed. I can recommend [Visual Studio Code][vsc] (on linux) for IntelliSense and Refactoring support.

If you have ideas to make this better please open an issue, or even better, send a pull request.
